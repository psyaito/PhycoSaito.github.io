            <p>A complilation little language things that I've noticed</p>
            <p>Brailles are very interesting, its actually a binary "writing" system. Whats really interesting is how it's adapted into different languages. Japanese braille (点字）is really well thought out.</p>
            <p>6/8/2023 - A lot more companies are using the term "recyclable", which is good. However, it feels a bit sleezy to make it sound like its recycled, even though its not. Outright deceptive if the plastic is not HDPE, which it sometimes is.</p>
